# Welcome to Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is designed
to become a superset of Python over time.

To use Mojo, you can install the MAX SDK or the standalone Mojo SDK:

- [Get the MAX SDK.](https://docs.modular.com/engine/get-started)
- [Get the Mojo SDK.](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/)

Then follow the docs to [write your first Mojo
program](https://https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/hello-world).
When you want to report issues or request features, [please create a GitHub
issue here](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues). See the [Mojo
Contributor Guide](https://www.notion.so/f527254bc46b4cd3ba4b34bd949d4e57?pvs=21)
for guidelines on filing good bugs.

This repo includes source code for:

- Mojo examples
- Mojo documentation hosted at [modular.com](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)
- The [Mojo standard library](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/lib)

This repo has two primary branches:

- The [`main`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/main) branch, which is in
sync with the last released version of Mojo. Use the examples here if youâ€™re
using a release build of Mojo.

- The [`nightly`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/nightly) branch, which
is in sync with the Mojo nightly build and subject to breakage. Use this branch
for [contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

This repo represents the Mojo open source effort. We are continuing to open
parts of the Mojo codebase. The challenge is that we use Mojo pervasively
inside Modular and we need to make sure that community contributions can
proceed smoothly with good build and testing tools that will allow this repo to
become the source of truth (right now it is not). We'll progressively improve
the tools and add more source code over time.

If youâ€™d like to contribute to Mojo, please first read our [Contributor
Guide](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
