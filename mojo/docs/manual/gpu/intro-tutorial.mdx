import Requirements from '@site/src/components/Requirements';
import { requirementsWithGPU } from '@site/docs/max/requirements';

This tutorial introduces you to GPU programming using Mojo and the MAX Driver.
You'll learn how to write a simple program that performs vector addition on a
GPU, exploring fundamental concepts of GPU programming along the way.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand basic GPU programming concepts like grids and thread blocks
- Learn how to move data between CPU and GPU memory
- Write and compile a simple GPU kernel function
- Execute parallel computations on the GPU

We'll build everything step-by-step, starting with the basics and gradually
adding more complexity. The concepts you learn here will serve as a foundation
for more advanced GPU programming with Mojo.

:::note

Mojo's `gpu` package provides a low-level API for GPU programming. In contrast,
the MAX Driver provides a higher-level API for GPU programming with easy-to-use
abstractions for managing devices and memory. We're using the MAX Driver in this
tutorial because it's easier to use and more convenient for many tasks. If
you're interested in learning more about the `gpu` package, see the [GPU
basics](/mojo/manual/gpu/basics) section of the Mojo Manual.

:::

System requirements:

<Requirements requirementsData={requirementsWithGPU} />

## 1. Create a Mojo project with `magic`

We'll start by using the [`magic`](/magic) CLI to create a virtual environment
and generate our initial project directory.

1. <GetMagic />

2. Navigate to the directory in which you want to create the project
    and execute:

    ```bash
    magic init gpu-intro --format mojoproject
    ```

    This creates a project directory named `gpu-intro`.

3. Let's go into the directory and verify the project is configured
    correctly by checking the version of Mojo that's installed within our
    project's virtual environment:

    ```bash
    cd gpu-intro
    ```

    ```bash
    magic run mojo --version
    ```

    You should see a version string indicating the version of Mojo installed,
    which by default should be the latest nightly version. Because we used the
    `--format mojoproject` option when creating the project, `magic`
    automatically added the `max` package as a dependency, which includes Mojo
    and the MAX libraries.

4. Activate the project's virtual environment:

    ```bash
    magic shell
    ```
    Later on, when you want to exit the virtual environment, just type `exit`.

## 2. Get references to the CPU and GPU

When using the MAX Driver, the [`Device`](/max/api/mojo/driver/device/Device)
class represents a logical instance of a device, for example, a CPU or GPU. The
[`cpu()`](/max/api/mojo/driver/device/cpu) and `accelerator()` functions return
a `Device` reference to the CPU and GPU, respectively. If no GPU is available,
the `accelerator()` function raises an error. You can use the
[`has_accelerator()`](/mojo/stdlib/sys/info/has_accelerator/) function to check
if a GPU is available.

So let's start by writing a program that checks if a GPU is available and then
creates a CPU and GPU device. Using any editor, create a file named
`vector_addition.mojo` with the following code:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
from max.driver import accelerator, cpu
from sys import exit, has_accelerator

def main():
    if not has_accelerator():
        print("A GPU is required to run this program")
        exit()

    host_device = cpu()
    print("Found the CPU device")
    gpu_device = accelerator()
    print("Found the GPU device")
```

Save the file and run it using the `mojo` CLI:

```bash
mojo vector_addition.mojo
```

You should see the following output:

```output
Found the CPU device
Found the GPU device
```

:::note

If you don't have a GPU, you'll see the following message:

```output
A GPU is required to run this program
```

In that case, you need to find a system that has a supported GPU to continue
with this tutorial.

:::

## 3. Define a simple kernel

A GPU *kernel* is simply a function that runs on a GPU, executing a specific
computation on a large dataset in parallel across thousands or millions of
*threads*. You might already be familiar with threads when programming for a
CPU, but GPU threads are different. On a CPU, threads are managed by the
operating system and can perform completely independent tasks, such as managing
a user interface, fetching data from a database, and so on. But on a GPU,
threads are managed by the GPU itself. All the threads on a GPU execute the same
kernel function, but they each work on a different part of the data.

When you run a kernel, you need to specify the number of threads you want to
use. The number of threads you specify depends on the size of the data you want
to process and the amount of parallelism you want to achieve. A common strategy
is to use one thread per element of data in the result. So if you're performing
an elementwise addition of two 1,024-element vectors, you'd use 1,024 threads.

A *grid* is the top-level organizational structure for the threads executing a
kernel function. A grid consists of multiple *thread blocks*, which are further
divided into individual threads that execute the kernel function concurrently.
The GPU assigns a unique block index to each thread block, and a unique thread
index to each thread within a block. Threads within the same thread block can
share data through shared memory and synchronize using built-in mechanisms, but
they cannot directly communicate with threads in other blocks. For this
tutorial, we won't get in the details of why or how to do this, but it's an
important concept to keep in mind when you're writing more complex kernels.

To better understand how grids, thread blocks, and threads work together, let's
write a simple kernel function that prints the thread block and thread indices.
Add the following code to your `vector_addition.mojo` file:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
from gpu.id import block_idx, thread_idx

fn print_threads():
    """Print thread IDs."""
    print("Block index: [",
        block_idx.x,
        "]\tThread index: [",
        thread_idx.x,
        "]"
    )
```

:::note

We're using `fn` here without the `raises` keyword because a kernel function is
not allowed to raise an error condition. In contrast, when you define a Mojo
function with `def`, the compiler always assumes that the function *can* raise
an error condition. See the [Functions](/mojo/manual/functions) section of the
Mojo Manual for more information on the difference between using `fn` and `def`
to define functions in Mojo.

:::

## 4. Compile and run the kernel

Next, we need to update the `main()` function to compile the kernel function for
our GPU and then run it, specifying the number of thread blocks in the grid and
the number of threads per thread block. For this initial example, let's define a
grid consisting of 2 thread blocks, each with 64 threads. Update the imports and
modify the `main()` function so that your program looks like this:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
from gpu.host import Dim
from gpu.id import block_idx, thread_idx
from max.driver import Accelerator, Device, accelerator, cpu
from sys import exit, has_accelerator

fn print_threads():
    """Print thread IDs."""
    print("Block index: [",
        block_idx.x,
        "]\tThread index: [",
        thread_idx.x,
        "]"
    )

def main():
    if not has_accelerator():
        print("A GPU is required to run this program")
        exit()

    host_device = cpu()
    print("Found the CPU device")
    gpu_device = accelerator()
    print("Found the GPU device")

    print_threads_gpu = Accelerator.compile[print_threads](gpu_device)

    print_threads_gpu(gpu_device, grid_dim=Dim(2), block_dim=Dim(64))

    # Required for now to keep the main thread alive until the GPU is done
    Device.wait_for(gpu_device)
    print("Program finished")
```

Save the file and run it:

```bash
mojo vector_addition.mojo
```

You should see something like the following output (which is abbreviated here):

```output
Found the CPU device
Found the GPU device
Block index: [ 1 ]	Thread index: [ 0 ]
Block index: [ 1 ]	Thread index: [ 1 ]
Block index: [ 1 ]	Thread index: [ 2 ]
...
Block index: [ 0 ]	Thread index: [ 30 ]
Block index: [ 0 ]	Thread index: [ 31 ]
Program finished
```

The `Accelerator.compile()` function compiles a kernel function so that it can
run on a particular GPU architecture. You specify the name of the kernel
function as a compile-time Mojo *parameter* and the target GPU device as a
run-time Mojo argument. (See the [Functions](/mojo/manual/functions) section of
the Mojo Manual for more information on Mojo function arguments and the
[Parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters) section for more information on Mojo
compile-time parameters and metaprogramming.)

When you invoke the compiled kernel function, the MAX Driver executes it
asynchronously on the GPU. You must provide the following arguments in this
order:

- The target GPU device
- Any additional arguments specified by the kernel function definition (none, in
  this case)
- The grid dimensions, using the `grid_dim` keyword argument
- The thread block dimensions, using the `block_dim` keyword argument

:::note

Mojo currently doesn't typecheck the arguments to the compiled kernel function.
This means that you can encounter obscure errors if the ordering, types, or
argument count doesn't match. We're working to add more robust typechecking
soon.

:::

We're invoking the compiled kernel function with `grid_dim=Dim(2)` and
`block_dim=Dim(64)`, which means we're using a grid of 2 thread blocks,
with 64 threads each for a total of 128 threads in the grid.

When you run a kernel, the GPU assigns each thread block within the grid to a
*streaming multiprocessor* for execution. A streaming multiprocessor (SM) is the
fundamental processing unit of a GPU, designed to execute multiple parallel
workloads efficiently. Each SM contains several cores, which perform the actual
computations of the threads executing on the SM, along with shared resources
like registers, shared memory, and control mechanisms to coordinate the
execution of threads. The number of SMs and the number of cores on a GPU depends
on its architecture. For example, the NVIDIA H100 PCIe contains 114 SMs, with
128 32-bit floating point cores per SM.

Additionally, when an SM is assigned a thread block, it divides the block into
multiple *warps*, which are groups of 32 or 64 threads, depending on the GPU
architecture. These threads execute the same instruction simultaneously in a
*single instruction, multiple threads* (SIMT) model. The SM's *warp scheduler*
coordinates the execution of warps on an SM's cores.

Warps are used to efficiently utilize GPU hardware by maximizing throughput and
minimizing control overhead. Since GPUs are designed for high-performance
parallel processing, grouping threads into warps allows for streamlined
instruction scheduling and execution, reducing the complexity of managing
individual threads. Multiple warps from multiple thread blocks can be active
within an SM at any given time, enabling the GPU to keep execution units busy.
For example, if the threads of a particular warp are blocked waiting for data
from memory, the warp scheduler can immediately switch execution to another warp
that's ready to run.

:::note

When you invoke the compiled kernel function, the MAX Driver executes it
asynchronously on the GPU. In a typical program, the kernel generates some
result that you then copy back to the CPU. That copy operation, which we'll see
later in this tutorial, blocks until the kernel is done and the result is ready
to copy.

In this kernel, we're just printing the thread IDs and there is no result to
return. That's why we're using the
[`Device.wait_for()`](/max/api/mojo/driver/device/Device#wait_for) call in this
example to block the main thread of the CPU until the GPU is done executing the
kernel function. Otherwise, the program would exit before the GPU could finish
executing the kernel.

:::

## 5. Manage grid dimensions

The grid in the previous step consisted of a one-dimensional grid of 2 thread
blocks with 64 threads in each block. However, you can also organize the thread
blocks in a two- or even a three-dimensional grid. Similarly, you can arrange
the threads in a thread block across one, two, or three dimensions. Typically,
you determine the dimensions of the grid and thread blocks based on the
dimensionality of the data to process. For example, you might choose a
1-dimensional grid for processing large vectors, a 2-dimensional grid for
processing matrices, and a 3-dimensional grid for processing the frames of a
video.

To better understand how grids, thread blocks, and threads work together, let's
modify our `print_threads()` kernel function to print the `x`, `y`, and `z`
components of the thread block and thread indices for each thread.

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
fn print_threads():
    """Print thread IDs."""
    print("Block index: [",
        block_idx.x, block_idx.y, block_idx.z,
        "]\tThread index: [",
        thread_idx.x, thread_idx.y, thread_idx.z,
        "]"
    )
```

Then, update the `main()` function to invoke the compiled kernel function with a
2x2x1 grid of thread blocks and a 16x4x2 arrangement of threads within each
thread block:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
    print_threads_gpu(
        gpu_device,
        grid_dim=Dim(2, 2, 1),
        block_dim=Dim(16, 4, 2)
    )
```

Save the file and run it again:

```bash
mojo vector_addition.mojo
```

You should see something like the following output (which is abbreviated here):

```output
Found the CPU device
Found the GPU device
Block index: [ 0 1 0 ]	Thread index: [ 0 2 0 ]
Block index: [ 0 1 0 ]	Thread index: [ 1 2 0 ]
Block index: [ 0 1 0 ]	Thread index: [ 2 2 0 ]
...
Block index: [ 1 1 0 ]	Thread index: [ 14 3 0 ]
Block index: [ 1 1 0 ]	Thread index: [ 15 3 0 ]
Program finished
```

Try changing the grid and thread block dimensions to see how the output changes.

:::note

The maximum number of threads per thread block and threads per SM is
GPU-specific. For example, the NVIDIA A100 GPU has a maximum of 1,024 threads
per thread block and 2,048 threads per SM.

Choosing the size and shape of the grid and thread blocks is a balancing act
between maximizing the number of threads that can execute concurrently and
minimizing the amount of time spent waiting for data to be loaded from memory.
Factors such as the size of the data to process, the number of SMs on the GPU,
and the memory bandwidth of the GPU can all play a role in determining the
optimal grid and thread block dimensions. One general guideline is to choose a
thread block size that is a multiple of the warp size. This helps to maximize
the utilization of the GPU's resources and minimizes the overhead of managing
multiple warps.

:::


## 6. Model our data using `Tensor`

Now that you understand how to manage grid dimensions, let's get ready to create
a kernel that performs a simple elementwise addition of two vectors of floating
point numbers.

We'll start by determining how to represent our data. Although we're going to be
using one-dimensional data, we'll use a data type called a *tensor* that's
capable of representing multi-dimensional data — basically, a multi-dimensional
array. Because we have only a single dimension of data, this will be a *rank-1*
tensor.

We'll use the [`Tensor`](/max/api/mojo/driver/tensor/Tensor) class from the
`max.driver` package to represent our data. This `Tensor` class is a convenience
class that can allocate memory for the tensor on either the CPU or the GPU. It
also includes methods for moving and copying the data between the CPU and the
GPU.

Let's add `Tensor` to the list of imports and then update `main()` to create two
input tensors on the CPU. We won't need the `print_threads()` kernel function
anymore, so we can remove it and the code to compile and invoke it. So after all
that, your `vector_addition.mojo` file should look like this:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
from gpu.host import Dim
from gpu.id import block_idx, thread_idx
from max.driver import Accelerator, Tensor, accelerator, cpu
from sys import exit, has_accelerator

alias float_dtype = DType.float32
alias tensor_rank = 1
alias vector_size = 100

def main():
    if not has_accelerator():
        print("A GPU is required to run this program")
        exit()

    host_device = cpu()
    gpu_device = accelerator()

    # Allocate the two input tensors on the host.
    lhs_tensor = Tensor[float_dtype, tensor_rank](vector_size, host_device)
    rhs_tensor = Tensor[float_dtype, tensor_rank](vector_size, host_device)

    # Fill them with initial values.
    for i in range(vector_size):
        lhs_tensor[i] = Float32(i)
        rhs_tensor[i] = Float32(i * 0.5)

    print("lhs_tensor:", lhs_tensor)
    print("rhs_tensor:", rhs_tensor)
```

The program starts by defining some compile-time aliases for the data type and
the size of the vector we're going to process. Then, the `main()` function
initializes two input tensors on the CPU.

The `Tensor` constructor has two compile-time parameters:

- `type`: The element data type. We're specifying `float_dtype`, our alias for
  `DType.float32`.

- `rank`: The rank of the tensor. We're specifying `tensor_rank`, our alias for
  1.

We're also passing two run-time arguments to the constructor:

- `shape`: The *shape* of the tensor, which is the size of each dimension of the
  tensor. You can provide an instance of the
  [`TensorShape`](/max/api/mojo/tensor/tensor_shape/TensorShape/) struct, a Mojo
  tuple of integers, or for a rank-1 tensor a single integer. Here, we're
  providing a single integer, `vector_size`, which is our alias for 100.

- `device`: The device on which to allocate the tensor. If you omit this
  argument, the tensor is allocated on the host by default. Here, we're
  explicitly specifying `host_device` to make our intent clear.

After allocating the tensors, we fill them with initial values and then print
them.

Now let's run the program to verify that everything is working so far.

```bash
mojo vector_addition.mojo
```

You should see the following output:

```output
lhs_tensor: Tensor([[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, ..., 97.0, 98.0, 99.0]], dtype=float32, shape=100)
rhs_tensor: Tensor([[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, ..., 48.5, 49.0, 49.5]], dtype=float32, shape=100)
```

## 7. Move the input tensors to the GPU and allocate an output tensor

Now that we have our input tensors allocated and initialized on the CPU, let's
move them to the GPU so that they'll be available for the kernel function to
use.

Add the following code to the end of the `main()` function:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
    # Move the input tensors to the accelerator.
    lhs_tensor = lhs_tensor.move_to(gpu_device)
    rhs_tensor = rhs_tensor.move_to(gpu_device)
```

The [`move_to()`](/max/api/mojo/driver/tensor/Tensor#move_to) method returns a
new `Tensor` object that is allocated on the specified device. It also
implicitly calls the destructor on the original `Tensor` object, freeing the
memory associated with it. The Mojo compiler would report an error if you tried
to use the original `Tensor` object after moving it to the GPU. We could declare
new variables to hold the moved tensors, but in this example we'll just reuse
the original names.

Next, let's allocate an output tensor on the GPU to hold the result of the
kernel function. Add the following code to the end of the `main()` function:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
    # Allocate the output tensor on the accelerator.
    out_tensor = Tensor[float_dtype, tensor_rank](vector_size, gpu_device)
```

## 8. Create `LayoutTensor` views

One last step before writing the kernel function is that we're going to create a
[`LayoutTensor`](/mojo/stdlib/layout/layout_tensor/LayoutTensor/) view for each
of the tensors. `LayoutTensor` provides a powerful abstraction for
multi-dimensional data with precise control over memory organization. It
supports various memory layouts (row-major, column-major, tiled),
hardware-specific optimizations, and efficient parallel access patterns. We
won't go into the details of using `LayoutTensor` in this tutorial, but in more
complex kernels it's a useful tool for manipulating your data.

All we need to do is add the following code to the end of the `main()` function:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
    # Create a LayoutTensor for each tensor.
    lhs_layout_tensor = lhs_tensor.to_layout_tensor()
    rhs_layout_tensor = rhs_tensor.to_layout_tensor()
    out_layout_tensor = out_tensor.to_layout_tensor()
```

## 9. Define and compile the vector addition kernel function

Now we're ready to write the kernel function. Add the following code to
`vector_addition.mojo`:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
from gpu.id import block_dim, block_idx, thread_idx
from layout import LayoutTensor, Layout

...

alias block_size = 32

fn vector_addition[
    lhs_layout: Layout,
    rhs_layout: Layout,
    out_layout: Layout,
](
    lhs: LayoutTensor[float_dtype, lhs_layout, MutableAnyOrigin],
    rhs: LayoutTensor[float_dtype, rhs_layout, MutableAnyOrigin],
    out: LayoutTensor[float_dtype, out_layout, MutableAnyOrigin],
):
    """The calculation to perform across the vector on the GPU."""

    alias size = out_layout.size()  # Force compile-time evaluation.
    tid = block_dim.x * block_idx.x + thread_idx.x
    if tid < size:
        out[tid] = lhs[tid] + rhs[tid]
```

Our `vector_addition()` kernel function accepts the two input tensors and the
output tensor as arguments. It also accepts compile-time `Layout` parameters for
each of the tensors. (For example, `lhs_layout` is the inferred layout for the
`lhs` argument.) A [`Layout`](/mojo/stdlib/layout/layout/Layout) is a
representation of memory layouts using shape and stride information, and it maps
between logical coordinates and linear memory indices. In our kernel function,
we use only the layout of the `out` tensor to determine the size of the vector.

It's important to know the size of the vector because it might not be a multiple
of the block size. In fact in this example, the size of the vector is 100, which
is not a multiple of our block size of 32. So as we assign our threads to read
elements from the tensor, we need to make sure we don't overrun the bounds of
the tensor.

The body of the kernel function starts by calculating linear index of the tensor
element that a particular thread is responsible for. The `block_dim` object
(which we added to the list of imports) contains the dimensions of the thread
blocks as `x`, `y`, and `z` values. Because we're going to use a one-dimensional
grid of thread blocks, we need only the `x` dimension. We can then calculate
`tid`, the unique "global" index of the thread within the output tensor as
`block_dim.x * block_idx.x + thread_idx.x`. For example, the `tid` values for
the threads in the first thread block range from 0 to 31. The `tid` values for
the threads in the second thread block range from 32 to 63, and so on.

The function then checks if the calculated `tid` is less than the size of the
output tensor. If it is, the thread reads the corresponding elements from the
`lhs` and `rhs` tensors, adds them together, and stores the result in the
corresponding element of the `out` tensor.

Now that we've written the kernel function, we can compile it by adding the
following code to the end of the `main()` function:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
    # Compile the kernel function to run on the GPU.
    gpu_function = Accelerator.compile[
        vector_addition[
            lhs_layout_tensor.layout,
            rhs_layout_tensor.layout,
            out_layout_tensor.layout,
        ]
    ](gpu_device)
```

## 10. Invoke the kernel function and move the output back to the CPU

The last step is to invoke the kernel function and move the output back to the
CPU. Add this line to the list of imports at the top of the file:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
from math import ceildiv
```

Then, add the following code to the end of the `main()` function:

```mojo title="vector_addition.mojo"
    # Calculate the number of thread blocks needed by dividing the vector size
    # by the block size and rounding up.
    num_blocks = ceildiv(vector_size, block_size)

    # Invoke the kernel function.
    gpu_function(
        gpu_device,
        lhs_layout_tensor,
        rhs_layout_tensor,
        out_layout_tensor,
        grid_dim=Dim(num_blocks),
        block_dim=Dim(block_size),
    )

    # Move the output tensor back onto the CPU so that we can read the results.
    out_tensor = out_tensor.move_to(host_device)

    print("out_tensor:", out_tensor)
```

    out_layout_tensor = out_tensor.to_layout_tensor()

    # Compile the kernel function to run on the GPU.
    gpu_function = Accelerator.compile[
        vector_addition[
            lhs_layout_tensor.layout,
            rhs_layout_tensor.layout,
            out_layout_tensor.layout,
        ]
    ](gpu_device)

    # Calculate the number of thread blocks needed by dividing the vector size
    # by the block size and rounding up.
    num_blocks = ceildiv(vector_size, block_size)

    # Invoke the kernel function.
    gpu_function(
        gpu_device,
        lhs_layout_tensor,
        rhs_layout_tensor,
        out_layout_tensor,
        grid_dim=Dim(num_blocks),
        block_dim=Dim(block_size),
    )

    # Move the output tensor back onto the CPU so that we can read the results.
    out_tensor = out_tensor.move_to(host_device)

    print("out_tensor:", out_tensor)
```
</details>

First we calculate the number of thread blocks needed by dividing the vector
size by the block size and rounding up. Then we can invoke the kernel function.

After that, we move the output tensor back onto the CPU so that we can read the
results. This call blocks on the CPU until the kernel function has populated the
output tensor and returned. The move also has the side effect of invoking the
destructor for the original `out_tensor` object and freeing its allocated memory
on the GPU. As for the input tensors, we don't need to move them back to the
CPU. Also, the Mojo compiler determines that the `lhs_tensor` and `rhs_tensor`
objects are no longer needed after the kernel function has returned, and so it
automatically invokes their destructors to free their allocated memory on the
GPU. (For a detailed explanation of object lifetime and destruction in Mojo, see
the [Death of a value](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/death) section of the Mojo
Manual.)

So it's finally time to run the program to see the results of our hard work.

```bash
mojo vector_addition.mojo
```

You should see the following output:

```output
lhs_tensor:  Tensor([[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, ..., 97.0, 98.0, 99.0]], dtype=float32, shape=100)
rhs_tensor:  Tensor([[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, ..., 48.5, 49.0, 49.5]], dtype=float32, shape=100)
out_tensor:  Tensor([[0.0, 1.5, 3.0, ..., 145.5, 147.0, 148.5]], dtype=float32, shape=100)
```

And now that you're done with the tutorial, exit your project's virtual
environment:

```bash
exit
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we've learned how to use the MAX Driver to write a simple
kernel function that performs an elementwise addition of two vectors. We
covered:

- Understanding basic GPU concepts like devices, grids, and thread blocks
- Moving data between CPU and GPU memory using tensors
- Writing and compiling a GPU kernel function
- Executing parallel computations on the GPU
- Managing memory and object lifetimes across devices
