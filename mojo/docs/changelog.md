# Mojo unreleased changelog

This is a list of UNRELEASED changes for the Mojo language and tools.

When we cut a release, these notes move to `changelog-released.md` and that's
what we publish.

## UNRELEASED

### ‚ú® Highlights

- Parts of the Kernel library continue to be progressively open sourced!
  Packages that are open sourced now include:
  - `kv_cache`
  - `quantization`
  - `nvml`
  - Benchmarks

### Language changes

### Standard library changes

- The `CollectionElement` trait has been removed.
- Added support for RTX2060 GPUs.

Changes to Python-Mojo interoperability:

- `Python.{unsafe_get_python_exception, throw_python_exception_if_error_state}`
  have been removed in favor of `CPython.{unsafe_get_error, get_error}`.

- Since virtually any operation on a `PythonObject` can raise, the
  `PythonObject` struct no longer implements the `Indexer` and `Intable` traits.
  Instead, it now conforms to `IntableRaising`, and users should convert
  explictly to builtin types and handle exceptions as needed. In particular, the
  `PythonObject.__int__` method now returns a Python `int` instead of a mojo
  `Int`, so users must explicitly convert to a mojo `Int` if they need one (and
  must handle the exception if the conversion fails, e.g. due to overflow).

- `PythonObject` no longer implements `Stringable`. Instead, the
  `PythonObject.__str__` method now returns a Python `str` object and can raise.
  The new `Python.str` function can also be used to convert an arbitrary
  `PythonObject` to a Python `str` object.

- `String` now implements `ConvertibleFromPython`.
