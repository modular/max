# Phase 1

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Modular kernel library! We
recently made our kernel codebase available as a foundation for building
high-performance CPU and GPU code with Mojo.

**We are not yet accepting external contributions to the kernel library, but we
expect to open contributions in the next month or two.** We will provide
detailed information about timing, contribution guidelines, and how to get
involved soon. [The Modular forum](https://forum.modular.com/) is the best place
to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

In the meantime, you can still support the project by testing the kernels,
filing bugs, and suggesting improvements through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modular/max/issues).

## Submitting bugs

Reporting issues is a great way to contribute to the project. The kernel library
uses GitHub Issues for tracking bugs.

Keep in mind that bugs with a reproducible test case and well-written supporting
documentation are considered a higher priority. Ensure that reproducible steps
are the smallest possible to maximize contributor time.

Also, before opening a new issue, take a moment to search through the already
submitted issues to avoid creating duplicate issues for the maintainers to
address.

### Writing high-quality bug descriptions

We encourage you to provide as much information about the issue as practical.
The more details you provide, the faster we can resolve the issue. The following
is a template of the information that should accompany every submitted issue.

### Issue template

- **Summary:** a descriptive summary of the issue.
- **Description:** a detailed account of the bug, including what was expected
and what occurred.
- **Environment details**
  - Mojo compiler version
  - Operating system version
  - Hardware specifications
- **Severity/frequency**: an assessment of the impact ranging from inconvenience
to a blocker.

### Guidelines for Review Time

#### Issue Triage Timeline

- New Issues:
  - Maintainers will label and acknowledge new issues within 10 days of the
    issue submission.

#### Exceptions

While we strive our best to adhere to these timelines, there may be occasional
delays due any of the following:

- High volume of contributions.
- Maintainers' availability (e.g. holidays, team events).
- Complex Issues requiring extended discussion â€” please bring these to the
[Modular forums](https://forum.modular.com/), where we can engage more deeply
with the community in the decision-making process.

If delays occur, we'll provide status updates in the relevant GitHub Issue.
