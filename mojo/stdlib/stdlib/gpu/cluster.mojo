"""This module provides low-level NVIDIA GPU cluster synchronization primitives for SM90+ architectures.

The module implements thread block cluster operations that enable efficient communication and
synchronization between thread blocks (CTAs) within a cluster on NVIDIA Hopper architecture and newer GPUs.

All functions are constrained to NVIDIA SM90+ GPUs and will raise an error if used on unsupported hardware.

Note: These are low-level primitives that correspond directly to PTX/NVVM instructions and should be used
with careful consideration of the underlying hardware synchronization mechanisms.
