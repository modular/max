"""Elementwise operations on graph tensor `Symbol`s.

Operations in this library are split into two main kinds:

*Unary operations*

Elementwise-unary-operations all have the following properties:
- They operate on a single symbolic tensor value of any shape
- Their output is a single symbolic tensor value with the same shape as their
    input
- The computation they represent will be itemwise-independent, in other words
    the output value in any position of the output tensor at computation time
    will depend only on the input value at that same position, and no others.

*Binary operations*

Elementwise-binary-operations all have the following properties:
- They operate on two symbolic tensor values, a `left` value and a `right`
    value.
- The input tensor types must be compatible according to the
    elementwise_broadcast()` broadcasting rules. `broadcasting` documentation
    for more details.
- If the input tensor types have different element types, they will each
    be "promoted" to some dtype according to `type_promotion.promote()`
    _before_ executing the operation. This may involve a cast that changes
    the representation (including precision) of the data values.
    See the `type_promotion` documentation for more details.
- Their output is a single symbolic tensor value with
    - dtype depending on the op and the _promoted_ dtype, ie. `promote(lhs, rhs)`
    - shape equal to the result of `elementwise_broadcast(lhs, rhs)`
- The computation they represent will be itemwise-independent, in other words
    _after broadcasting_ the input values to the same shape, the output value in
    any position of the output tensor at computation time will depend only on
    the input position at the two broadcast input values at that same
    position, and no others.
