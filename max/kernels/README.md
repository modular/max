# MAX Kernels

This directory contains low-level, high-performance compute kernels written in
[Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo), designed to serve as building blocks for
numerical, machine learning, and other performance-critical workloads.

Kernels in this directory are written using Mojo's systems programming
capabilities, including fine-grained control over memory layout, parallelism,
and hardware mapping. These implementations prioritize performance and
correctness, and are intended to be used both directly and as primitives in
higher-level libraries.
