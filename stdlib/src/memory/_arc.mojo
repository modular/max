    """Atomic reference-counted pointer inspired by Rust Arc.

    Semantics:
    - Thread-safe, memory managed through atomic increments/decrements to the
        reference count.
        - Invariants:
            - References to this object must not outlive the object (handled by language)
            - References to this object must not cross a thread boundary
        As long as both invariants hold, this type is thread-safe (although
        the interior object may not be). Every reference points to a live
        lvalue on its own thread, which means __copyinit__ may only
        ever be called on an lvalue which is not currently in its __del__
        method. This prevents any race condition where one copy tries to
        free the underlying memory while another copy is being created,
        since a copy being created is always being created from another
        live copy on its own thread.

        Note that the _interior_ of the data is not thread safe; the guarantees
        here apply only to the memory management. Calling `.set` or mutating the
        interior value in any way is not guaranteed to be safe! Any interior data
        that will be mutated should manage synchronization somehow.
    - Copies use atomic reference counting for memory management.
        - Copying the Arc object will increment the reference count in a thread-safe way.
        - Deleting the Arc object will decrement the reference count in a thread-safe way,
            and then call the custom deleter.

    Parameters:
        T: The type of the stored value.
