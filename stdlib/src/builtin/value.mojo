trait Movable:
    """The Movable trait denotes a type whose value can be moved.

    Implement the `Movable` trait on `Foo` which requires the `__moveinit__`
    method:

    ```mojo
    struct Foo(Movable):
        fn __init__(inout self):
            pass

        fn __moveinit__(inout self, owned existing: Self):
            print("moving")
    ```

    You can now use the ^ suffix to move the object instead of copying
    it inside generic functions:

    ```mojo
    fn return_foo[T: Movable](owned foo: T) -> T:
        return foo^

    var foo = Foo()
    var res = return_foo(foo^)
    ```

    ```plaintext

        """Create a new instance of the value by moving the value of another.

            existing: The value to move.

        ...


trait Copyable:
    """The Copyable trait denotes a type whose value can be copied.

    Example implementing the `Copyable` trait on `Foo` which requires the `__copyinit__`
