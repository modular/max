"""Module to contain some components of the future math module.

This is needed to work around some circular dependencies; all elements of this
module should be exposed by the current `math` module. The contents of this

trait Ceilable:
    """
    The `Ceilable` trait describes a type that defines a ceiling operation.

    Types that conform to `Ceilable` will work with the builtin `ceil`
    function. The ceiling operation always returns the same type as the input.

    For example:
    ```mojo
    from math import Ceilable, ceil

    struct Complex(Ceilable):
        var re: Float64
        var im: Float64
