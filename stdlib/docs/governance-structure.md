# Mojo Standard Library Governance Structure

**Leads:**
Rob Parolin ([@rparolin](https://github.com/rparolin)),
Joe Loser ([@JoeLoser](https://github.com/JoeLoser))

Leads are responsible for reviewing code changes, reviewing proposals for
evolving the standard library, and setting the roadmap.

Other projects have governance structures with the concept of sub-teams. The
Mojo Standard Library isnâ€™t large enough yet to support that level of
governance. It very well may in the future but as we scale we will re-evaluate
our governance structure and make changes accordingly.
