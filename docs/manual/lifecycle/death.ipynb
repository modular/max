        "So far, we've described how Mojo destroys a value at the point it's last used,\n",
        "and this works great in almost all situations. However, there are very rare\n",
        "situations in which Mojo simply cannot predict this correctly and will destroy\n",
        "a value that is still referenced through some other means.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, perhaps you're building a type with a field that carries a pointer\n",
        "to another field. The Mojo compiler won't be able to reason about the pointer,\n",
        "so it might destroy a field (`obj1`) when that field technically no longer\n",
        "used, even though another field (`obj2`) still holds a pointer to part of it.\n",
        "So, you might need to keep `obj1` alive until you can execute some special\n",
        "logic in the destructor or move initializer.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can force Mojo to keep a value alive up to a certain point by assigning the\n",
        "value to the `_` \"discard\" pattern at the point where it's okay to destroy it.\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```mojo\n",
        "fn __del__(owned self):\n",
        "    self.dump() # Self is still whole here\n",
        "\n",
        "    consume(self.obj2^)\n",
        "    _ = self.obj1\n",
        "    # Mojo keeps `obj1` alive until here, after its \"last use\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, if `consume()` refers to some value in `obj1` somehow, this\n",
        "ensures that Mojo does not destroy `obj1` until after the call to `consume()`,\n",
        "because assignment to the discard variable `_` is actually the last use.\n",
        "\n",
        "For other situations, you can also scope the lifetime of a value using the\n",
        "Python-style [`with`\n",
        "statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement).\n",
        "That is, for any value defined at the entrance to a `with` statement, Mojo will\n",
        "keep that value alive until the end of the `with` statement. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```mojo\n",
        "with open(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
        "    print(file.read())\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Other stuff happens here (whether using `file` or not)...\n",
        "    foo()\n",
        "    # `file` is alive up to the end of the `with` statement.\n",
        "\n",
