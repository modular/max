### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Mojo now supports adding a `@deprecated` decorator on structs, functions,
  traits, aliases, and global variables. The decorator marks the attached decl
  as deprecated and causes a warning to be emitted when the deprecated decl is
  referenced in user code. The decorator requires a deprecation message to be
  specified as a string literal.

  ```mojo
  @deprecated("Foo is deprecated, use Bar instead")
  struct Foo:
      pass

  fn outdated_api(x: Foo): # warning: Foo is deprecated, use Bar instead
      pass

  @deprecated("use another function!")
  fn bar():
      pass

  fn techdebt():
      bar() # warning: use another function!
  ```

- `int()` can now take a string and a specified base to parse an integer from a
  string: `int("ff", 16)` returns `255`. Additionally, if a base of zero is
  specified, the string will be parsed as if it was an integer literal, with the
  base determined by whether the string contains the prefix `"0x"`, `"0o"`, or
  `"0b"`. ([PR #2273](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2273) by
  [@artemiogr97](https://github.com/artemiogr97), fixes
  [#2274](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2274))

- Mojo now supports types to opt in to use the `abs` and `round` functions by
  implementing the `__abs__` and `__round__` methods (i.e. by conforming to the
  new `Absable` and `Roundable` traits), respectively, e.g.:

  ```mojo
  from math import sqrt

  @value
  struct Complex(Absable, Roundable):
      var re: Float64
      var im: Float64

      fn __abs__(self) -> Self:
          return Self(sqrt(self.re * self.re + self.im * self.im), 0.0)

      fn __round__(self) -> Self:
          return Self(round(self.re), round(self.im))
  ```

- The `abs, round, min, max, and divmod` functions have moved from `math` to
  `builtin`, so you no longer need to do
  `from math import abs, round, min, max, divmod`.

- Mojo now allows types to opt in to use the `floor()` and `ceil()` functions in
  the `math` module by implementing the `__floor__()` and `__ceil__()` methods
  (and so conforming to the new `math.Floorable` and `math.Ceilable` traits,
  respectively). For example:

  ```mojo
    from math import Ceilable, Floorable, ceil, floor

    @value
    struct Complex(Ceilable, Floorable):
      var re: Float64
      var im: Float64

      fn __ceil__(self) -> Self:
          return Self(ceil(re), ceil(im))

      fn __floor__(self) -> Self:
          return Self(floor(re), floor(im))
  ```

- Add an `InlinedArray` type that works on memory-only types.
  Compare with the existing `StaticTuple` type, which is conceptually an array
  type, but only worked on `AnyRegType`.
    ([PR #2294](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2294) by [@lsh](https://github.com/lsh))

- Base64 decoding support has been added.
    ([PR #2364](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2364) by [@mikowals](https://github.com/mikowals))

- Add `repr()` function and `Representable` trait.
    ([PR #2361](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2361) by [@mikowals](https://github.com/gabrieldemarmiesse))

- Add `SIMD.shuffle()` with `StaticIntTuple` mask.
    ([PR #2315](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2315) by [@mikowals](https://github.com/mikowals))

- Invoking `mojo package my-package -o my-dir` on the command line, where
  `my-package` is a Mojo package source directory, and `my-dir` is an existing
  directory, now outputs a Mojo package to `my-dir/my-package.mojopkg`.
  Previously, this had to be spelled out, as in `-o my-dir/my-package.mojopkg`.

- The Mojo Language Server now reports a warning when a local variable is unused.

- The `math` module now has `CeilDivable` and `CeilDivableRaising` traits that
  allow users to opt into the `math.ceildiv` function.

- Mojo now allows methods to declare `self` as a `Reference` directly, which
  can be useful for advanced cases of parametric mutabilty and custom lifetime
  processing.  Previously it required the use of an internal MLIR type to
  achieve this.

- `object` now implements all the bitwise operators.
    ([PR #2324](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2324) by [@LJ-9801](https://github.com/LJ-9801))

- A new `--validate-doc-strings` option has been added to `mojo` to emit errors
  on invalid doc strings instead of warnings.

- A new decorator, `@doc_private`, was added that can be used to hide a decl
  from being generated in the output of `mojo doc`. It also removes the
  requirement that the decl has documentation (e.g. when used with
  --diagnose-missing-doc-strings).

- `Dict` now implements `get(key)` and `get(key, default)` functions.
    ([PR #2519](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2519) by [@martinvuyk](https://github.com/martinvuyk))

- Debugger users can now set breakpoints on function calls in O0 builds even if
  the call has been inlined by the compiler.

- The `os` module now provides functionalty for adding and removing directories
  using `mkdir` and `rmdir`.
    ([PR #2430](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2430) by [@artemiogr97](https://github.com/artemiogr97))

- `Dict.__get_ref(key)`, allowing to get references to dictionary values.

### ü¶ã Changed

- The `abs` and `round` functions have moved from `math` to `builtin`, so you no
  longer need to do `from math import abs, round`.

- Many functions returning a pointer type have been unified to have a public
  API function of `unsafe_ptr()`.

- The `--warn-missing-doc-strings` flag for `mojo` has been renamed to
  `--diagnose-missing-doc-strings`.

- The `take` function in `Variant` and `Optional` has been renamed to
  `unsafe_take`.

- The `get` function in `Variant` has been replaced by `__refitem__`. That is,
  `v.get[T]()` should be replaced with `v[T]`.

- Various functions in the `algorithm` module are now moved to be
  builtin-functions.  This includes `sort`, `swap`, and `partition`.
  `swap` and `partition` will likely shuffle around as we're reworking
  our builtnin `sort` function and optimizing it.

### ‚ùå Removed

- The method `object.print()` has been removed. Since now, `object` has the
  `Stringable` trait, you can use `print(my_object)` instead.

- The `math.clamp` function has been removed in favor of a new `SIMD.clamp`
  method.

- The `math.round_half_down` and `math.round_half_up` functions are removed.
  These can be trivially implemented using the `ceil` and `floor` functions.

- The `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, and `mod` functions have been removed from the
  `math` module. Instead, users should rely on the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`
  operators, respectively.

- The `math.roundeven` function has been removed from the `math` module. The new
  `SIMD.roundeven` method now provides the identical functionality.

- The `math.div_ceil` function has been removed in favor of the `math.ceildiv`
  function.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [#2363](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2363) Fix LSP crashing on
  simple trait definitions.
- [#1787](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1787) Fix error when using
  `//` on `FloatLiteral` in alias expression.
- Made several improvements to dictionary performance. Dicts with integer keys
  are most heavily affected, but large dicts and dicts with large values
  will also see large improvements.
